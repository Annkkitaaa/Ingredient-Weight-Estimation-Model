# Ingredient Weight Estimation Model

## Overview
The Ingredient Weight Estimation Model aims to estimate the weight percentages of various ingredients in food items using machine learning techniques. The model leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze ingredient descriptions and employs Random Forest regression for weight estimation.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and scales numerical features.
- **NLP Integration**: Utilizes spaCy for extracting ingredient names from descriptions.
- **Random Forest Regression**: Trains a robust model to predict ingredient weight percentages.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measures performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the model.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning and model evaluation.
- **spaCy**: NLP library for ingredient extraction.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a CSV file containing ingredient descriptions and their corresponding weight percentages. Ensure that the dataset is structured correctly for optimal model performance.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ingredient-weight-estimation-model.git
   cd ingredient-weight-estimation-model
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn spacy
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your dataset CSV file in the specified path in the code.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. The script will preprocess the data, train the model, and provide evaluation metrics.

## Model Evaluation
The model has been evaluated using cross-validation, yielding the following results:
- **Average Cross-Validated MSE**: 4.17
- **Test Set MSE**: 2.49
- **R-squared**: 0.99

These metrics indicate strong performance in estimating ingredient weight percentages.

## Future Work
Future improvements may include:
- Enhancing ingredient categorization with more advanced NLP techniques.
- Implementing better handling of missing data.
- Experimenting with different modeling techniques and hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploying the model as a web application using Flask or Django.
